# Portfolio

## Description

This portfolio showcases the work I've completed in this bootcamp. It also gives insight to myself as a person as well as links to my social media where people can see the content I create. 

## Authors and acknowledgment
Thank you to my instructor Gary and TA Katy for assisting with the hover effects in my header and footer!
